                  <em>Time:</em> 2 months<br>
                  As part of their current business strategy, Volaris Airline decided to revamp their mobile app and separate it into two native versions which are not yet available to the public. I joined a team of around 20 Android developers in a comprehensive, modular system that’s separated by feature and fully implemented using Jetpack Compose and MVI design pattern.<br>

              <h4>Android Developer - Nimble.la<br><small>MAR 2021 - JUN 2023</small></h4>
              <p>I began my journey at Bambino as a Trainee and swiftly advanced to the role of sole developer within a year. During this time, I spearheaded the integration of Kotlin for new features and initiated a significant overhaul of the project’s architecture, transitioning from an MVP model to MVVM. This restructuring not only enhanced code organization but also yielded tangible benefits, including notable improvements in performance and a remarkable reduction in project size—up to 30% fewer lines of code by the time of my departure.</p>
              <p>Transitioning from my role at Bambino, I embarked on an exciting journey as an external contractor for Red Bull's Wings for Life World Run app. Joining a team of seasoned developers, I embraced cutting-edge technologies such as Jetpack Compose to deliver a seamless running experience for our users. My role also involved introducing Robolectric unit tests for our UI components.</p>

                  <em>Role:</em> Android Developer<br>
                  <em>Stack:</em> Java, Kotlin, MVVM, XML views<br>
                  <em>Time:</em> 2 years (Mar 2021 - Apr 2023)<br>
                  Babysitting app that connects families with the right babysitter based on a recommendations algorithm. At Bambino, I adeptly utilized XML views to meticulously craft our client's UI designs, employing a plethora of custom components. Additionally, recognizing the need to modernize a project that had matured over eight years, I introduced Retrofit for approximately 90% of the app's network calls. This strategic move not only streamlined communication with external servers but also contributed to the overall efficiency and longevity of the application.<br>

                  <em>Time:</em> 1 year (Apr 2023 - May 2024)<br>
                  Recognizing the paramount importance of user-centric design, I took the lead in revamping the permission request system for the Wings for Life World Run app. Through meticulous refactoring, I endeavored to establish a more streamlined and intuitive approach, culminating in the development of an initial user onboarding flow. This strategic enhancement not only prioritized the user experience but also reflected our unwavering commitment to delivering a top-tier product for Red Bull's global audience.<br>

                  <em>Stack:</em> Android<br>
                  <em>Time:</em> 1 year<br>
                  As a freelancer for Alfred, a burgeoning restaurant recommendation app startup, I embarked on the challenge of enhancing the app's codebase. Upon joining the project, I observed that the entire app was written in Java. Recognizing the potential for improvement, I gradually introduced Kotlin code into the project. This strategic transition yielded profound benefits, notably enhancing code readability and significantly improving performance. By leveraging Kotlin's concise syntax and powerful features, we not only streamlined development but also enhanced the app's overall efficiency.
